1. The Automation project uses ansible playbooks for  installation of OCP on Power and other post install customizations.

2. The use of Playbooks in Ansible is also another reason for the major advantages of Ansible. Playbooks are Ansible configuration files, and the language for writing them is YAML.

3. The architecture of [PowerVC](https://www.ibm.com/us-en/marketplace/powervc) uses the OpenStack platform to provide virtualization and cloud management customized for Power Systems.  This includes an IBM Power-specific user interface, and IBM-specific OpenStack drivers for Power Systems management interfaces like the hardware management console (HMC), plus scheduling capabilities. Clients looking for a fully open virtualized infrastructure can use PowerVC to manage their PowerKVM on Power deployments as well.

* Deployment of Power servers in the enterprise can be categorized into four types.
* PowerVM based servers managed by HMC.
* PowerVM based servers managed by PowerVC.
* KVM based servers managed by libvirt.
* Baremetal servers without any hypervisor (KVM or PowerVM)
